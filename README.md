# Assignment-of-OPP

The project what I planed to make is creating a UI to control the solar system like the flowing picture.

<br/>
But the UI window is a 2D picture, and the solar system is 3D space, if I add a UI window in the project, it will with a problem like the clock with. So i didnâ€™t create a 2D UI window.

<br/>
[Planet:](https://github.com/ChyweiChen/Assignment-of-OPP/blob/master/Planet.pde)

### The key code
1.Use PeasyCam code
<br/>

<br/>
Use PeasyCam you can do 3D Transformations, visit the solar system in different ways, make the planets bigger or smaller, make the all view in a 3D space.
<br/>
2.Use PVector
<br/>

Use the PVector value you can let the planets move around the sun in different directions in a 3D space.

3.Draw a really-time clock

The time of the clock is same as the really time.
